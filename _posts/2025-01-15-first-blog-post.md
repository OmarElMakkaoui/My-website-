# Exploring My Research Journey

Welcome to my first blog post! In this space, I plan to share insights, discoveries, and updates about my research projects. From modeling business distribution to exploring the dynamics of cell migration in wound healing, I aim to demonstrate how mathematical tools can solve real-world problems.

Stay tuned for more updates as I delve deeper into projects like:
- **Modeling Commercial Distribution Using Schelling’s Model**
- **Air Quality Forecasting in Île-de-France**
- **Reaction-Diffusion Systems for Wound Healing**
