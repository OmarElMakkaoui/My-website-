# Welcome to My Research Projects

Hello! My name is Omar El Makkaoui, and this is my minimalist website where I showcase my research projects and share ideas about topics I’m passionate about, such as **machine learning**, **operations research**,**social phenomena** and **sustainability**.

## Current Focus
- Developing scalable solutions for real-world challenges.
- Exploring the intersection of **data science** and **climate change**.
- Applying optimization techniques to improve decision-making.

## About Me
I am deeply interested in using my skills to make a tangible impact, particularly in areas like environmental sustainability, social phenomena, logistics, and data-driven solutions.

Feel free to explore my work and connect with me for collaborations or discussions.

## Featured Projects
### [Air Quality Forecasting](#)
Leveraged machine learning to predict air quality levels in real time and evaluate the impact of public policies on environmental planning.

### [Modeling Commercial Distribution Using Schelling’s Model](#)
Utilized probabilistic models and computational simulations to study the dynamics of business distribution and clustering in urban areas. Applied the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to discretize the problem and optimize retail outlet locations.

### [Chatbots with LangChain](#)
Developed a chatbot that integrates large language models to enhance student interaction and information accessibility.

### [Modeling Epidermal Wound Healing Using Reaction-Diffusion Systems](#)
Explored the dynamics of cell migration in wound healing through reaction-diffusion models, deriving governing equations and applying numerical methods to uncover the relationship between biological processes and their mathematical representations.
