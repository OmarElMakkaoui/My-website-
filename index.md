title: Welcome to My Research Projects
---


Hello! My name is Omar El Makkaoui, and this is my minimalist website where I showcase my research projects and share ideas about topics Iâ€™m passionate about, such as **machine learning**,**statistics**, **applied mathematics** **operations research**,**environmental climate**, **data science**,**social phenomena**,**sustainability** and **biology**.

## Current Focus
- Developing scalable solutions for real-world challenges.
- Exploring the intersection of **data science** and **climate change**.
- Applying optimization techniques to improve decision-making.

## About Me
I am deeply interested in using my skills to make a tangible impact, particularly in areas like environmental sustainability, social phenomena, logistics, and data-driven solutions.

Feel free to explore my work and connect with me for collaborations or discussions.

## Featured Projects
### [Air Quality Forecasting]
Developed predictive models using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and LSTM to analyze environmental data and assess the impact of public policies.

### [Modeling Commercial Distribution ](https://github.com/OmarElMakkaoui/Projects/blob/b31f3092faa1d89bfbd6c97b0e7f2f336d139f87/Modelling%20business%20distribution%20.pdf)
Utilized probabilistic models and computational simulations to study the dynamics of business distribution and clustering in urban areas. Applied the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to discretize the problem and optimize retail outlet locations.

### [Chatbots with LangChain]
Developed a chatbot that integrates large language models to enhance student interaction and information accessibility.

### [Modeling Epidermal Wound Healing Using Reaction-Diffusion Systems](https://github.com/OmarElMakkaoui/Projects/blob/48e643f70beb7263d391a06d1ff7ac7e8b05ab88/Modelling%20epidermal%20wound%20healing.pdf)

Explored the dynamics of cell migration in wound healing through reaction-diffusion models, deriving governing equations and applying numerical methods to uncover the relationship between biological processes and their mathematical representations.
